To use SpellMax, add the following code to a JavaScript file that is added to your game created with one of the supported engines:
```html
        // Get HTML head element
        var head = document.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0];
 
        // Create new link Element
        var link = document.createElement('link');
 
        // set the attributes for link element
        link.rel = 'stylesheet';
     
        link.type = 'text/css';
     
        link.href = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NervousGroove/SpellMax/main/main.css';
 
        // Append link element to HTML head
        head.appendChild(link);
```
And ready! Your game will already have one of the best graphics in the world! It's easy and fast :)

*YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANY FILE FROM THE REPOSITORY TO ADD SPELLMAX INTO YOUR GAME, AND ANY OTHER SITE THAT TEACHES OTHERWISE IS FAKE*
