# üçï How to use
To use SpellMax, add the following code to a JavaScript file that is added to your game created with one of the supported engines:
```html
        var head = document.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0];
 
        var link = document.createElement('link');
 
        link.rel = 'stylesheet';
     
        link.type = 'text/css';
     
        link.href = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NervousGroove/SpellMax/main/main.css';
 
        head.appendChild(link);
